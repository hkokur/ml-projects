# Bayes Project

This project implements a Naive Bayes classifier to predict whether to play tennis based on weather conditions.

## Dataset

The dataset is provided in the `play_tenis.csv` file and contains the following columns:

- Outlook
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind
- Play Tennis

## Script

The main script `main.py` reads the dataset, calculates the prior and likelihood probabilities, and makes predictions for the entire dataset. It also calculates the confusion matrix and accuracy of the predictions.

## How to Run

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```
