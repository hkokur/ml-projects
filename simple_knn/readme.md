# Simple KNN

This project implements a simple K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict whether to play tennis based on weather conditions.

## Files

- `play_tenis.csv`: The dataset containing weather conditions and the decision to play tennis.
- `model.csv`: The one-hot encoded dataset used as the model.
- `main.py`: The main script to train the model and make predictions.

## Running the Script

To run the main script, use the following command:
`python main.py`

Note: You can edit the comment lines to get more information about the algorithm.
